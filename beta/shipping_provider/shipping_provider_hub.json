Merchants have access to configure and customize these providers through the control panel as they would any other shipping provider.",

These can be any valid HTTPS URL using port 443, for example:\n\n`https://yourhost.com/rate`\n\nYour host and rate should be replaced with your own host and path. \n\n### Routes\n\nYou should create a URL to provide shipping quotes on your API. This is the URL used to check the available shipping rates. The second URL (optional) checks the merchant’s connection settings are valid. It can perform any checks necssary to do so such as looking up credentials in your database or calling a downstream service to verify them.\n\n### Requests and Responses\n\nBigCommerce will send and receive data using JSON. The request for rates will always be formatted using the [Base Rate Request Model](/carrier-service-api-beta/models/baseraterequest). The response for rates should be formatted using the [Carrier Quote Object](/carrier-service-api-beta/models/carrierquoteobject). The request to check for merchant app credentials will be formatted as Check Connection Options Request Payload and the response should be formatted using the  Check Connection Options Response Payload. \n\n### Error Handling\nIn the case of errors, error messages should be included in the response payload under the messages key.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n{\n  \"valid\": false,\n  \"messages\" [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Your account ID is invalid\",\n      \"type\": \"ERROR\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The resource should respond indicating if the credentials are valid and should provide an explanation of what is wrong.
