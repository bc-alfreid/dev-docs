Using a Stored Card\n\nTo pay with a stored card first a call must be made to the [Order Transaction API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api/v3/#/reference/orders/order-transactions) for the `payment_instrument_token`. This is then passed in as part of the request in the `token` field.\n\nThen a request must be made to the [payments/access_tokens](/create-payment-tokem/payment-access-token/paymentsaccesstokenspost) to get the authroization token that needs to be passed in the header. \n\nThen the body with the `payment_instrument_token` must sent using the [/payments](/process-payment/payment/paymentspost) endpoint. \n\nThe type will always be `stored_card`. \n\nCurrently, choosing which valuted card to use is not supported. Using the `payment_instrument_token` will ensure the correct card is used.\n\nThe `payment_method_id` is available from the [Order Transaction API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api/v3/#/reference/orders/order-transactions) `gateway`.\n\n### Current Supported Gateways\n- Authorize.Net\n- Paypal Powered by Braintree\n- CyberSource\n- Stripe",

The order will have to later be captured through the control panel. If the gateway is set for authorization and capture, it will authorize and capture the payment.\n\n### Stored Cards\nIt works with cards that are currently stored. It does not allow for cards to be stored via the API.\n\n### Control Panel\nOrders created and captured via the API will look the same as other orders created via the storefront or other apps. It will have unknown as the order source for now. \n\n### Payment Providers\nThis works with any payment provider BigCommerce supports. The test payment gateway is currently not supported\n\nFor credit cards and stored cards, it works with Braintree, Authorize.net, Stripe and Cybersource.\n\nThe API flow does not currently support hosted/offsite providers such as PayPal and Adyen and wallet type payments such as Amazon Pay.\n\n### Data Access\nThe card data is not accessible via the API once the payment is processed. A credit card can be passed in the request body.\n\n### Rate Limits\nBigCommerce has rates limits in place for this API. Some payment providers will provide checks on the incoming requests.",
