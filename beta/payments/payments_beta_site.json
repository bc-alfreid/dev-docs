To pay with a stored card, first make a call to the [Order Transaction API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/orders/orders-transactions-api) for the `payment_instrument_token`. This is then passed in as part of the request in the `token` field.\n\n2. Make a request to [payments/access_tokens](/create-payment-tokem/payment-access-token/paymentsaccesstokenspost) to get the authorization token that needs to be passed in the header.\n\n3. The request body containing the `payment_instrument_token` must sent using the [/payments](/process-payment/payment/paymentspost) endpoint.\n\n* The type field value will always be `stored_card`.\n* Currently, choosing which vaulted card to use is not supported. Specifying the `payment_instrument_token` will ensure the correct card is used.\n* You can retrieve the `payment_method_id` for your configured gateway from the [Order Transaction API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/orders/orders-transactions-api) gateway.\n\n### Current Supported Gateways\n- Authorize.Net\n- Paypal Powered by Braintree\n- CyberSource\n- Stripe",

It is created by BigCommerce.\n\n### Decline Payments\nIf a payment is declined it will return a 4XX error with details if available. \n\n### Authorization\nIf a payment gateway is configured for authorization only, the payment will be authorized at the time of processing. The order will have to later be captured through the control panel. If the gateway is set for authorization and capture, the payment will be authorized and captured when payment is processed.\n\n### Stored Cards\nThe Payments API supports payment with cards that are currently stored. It does not provide a method for storing new cards.\n\n### Control Panel\nOrders created and captured via the API will look the same as other orders created via the storefront or other apps. The order source will be “Checkout API.” \n\n### Payment Providers\nThe Payments API supports any payment provider BigCommerce supports. The test payment gateway is currently not supported.\n\nFor credit cards and stored cards, Payments API works with Braintree, Authorize.net, Stripe and Cybersource.\n\nThe API flow does not currently support hosted/offsite providers such as PayPal and Adyen and wallet type payments such as Amazon Pay.\n\n### Data Access\nThe card data is not accessible via the API once the payment is processed. \n\n### Rate Limits\nBigCommerce has rates limits in place for this API. Some payment providers will provide checks on the incoming requests.",
