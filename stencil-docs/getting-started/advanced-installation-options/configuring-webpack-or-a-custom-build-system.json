For the default Cornerstone theme, we provide the [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/docs/) build manager to handle these dependencies. \n\nAs you develop and customize a theme based on Cornerstone, you have option to reconfigure Webpack's watched folders, and to even substitute a different build system. These options are explained below.\n\nAll themes in the BigCommerce Theme Marketplace use Webpack. However, older versions of certain themes used the jspm JavaScript dependency manager instead of Webpack. Please see this page to determine (by version number) whether you are developing based on one of these earlier versions, and to find the required jspm setup procedures.",
