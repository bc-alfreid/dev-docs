Only the store owner can create API accounts; accounts are limited to 50 per store.\n\nTo create your API account and its corresponding token, use the following steps:\n\n1. Using the store owner's credentials, log into the control panel of the store for which you are developing. \n\n2. From the left nav, select `Advanced Settings` > `API Accounts`. This will display the Store API Accounts page.\n\n3. From the resulting Store API Accounts page, select the `Create API Account` button.\n\n4. In the `Name` field, summarize the purpose for which you will use these credentials. This name is for internal use only, so assign any name that you will recognize.\n\n_The BigCommerce platform does not validate this name, however, we recommend naming accounts by purpose to help you keep track of which accounts you need to keep active. You should assign a name that will make the account's purpose clear to you and other store administrators._\n\n5. Under OAuth Scopes, set the `Themes` selector to either `modify` or `read-only`.\n\n_The read-only scope is sufficient to authorize/initialize a Stencil theme. However, the modify scope will achieve the same goal, while also authorizing this account to upload themes to the store from the command line._\n\n6. Select `Save` at the page’s lower right-hand corner.\n\n_Doing so will display a modal, from which you can copy your `Client ID` and `Access Token` values. The modal will also prompt your browser to download a .txt file that contains your credentials. You will need these values to authorize and initialize your Stencil theme. If you're ready to do so now, move ahead to [Authorizing and Initializing Stencil](/stencil-docs/getting-started/launching-stencil/authorizing-and-initializing)._",
