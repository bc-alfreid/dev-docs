Cornerstone provides the standard file structure, base design pattern, and default file assets necessary to start developing a custom storefront experience.\n\nThe Cornerstone file structure consists of four main subdirectories. Within those subdirectories, you'll be directed to specific files in the Development Quick Start tutorial and in Stencil reference material:\n\n### `template/pages`\n`templates/pages` contains all the base template pages used in a BigCommerce online storefront. The pages are grouped by page category. In order to prevent any rendering errors, please avoid changing page names. For details, please see Templates Files > Templates Direcotry > [Pages Subdirectory](/stencil-docs/template-files/templates-directory/pages-subdirectory).\n\n\n### `template/components`\n`templates/components` Components consist of code snippets and partials that can be reused throughout your theme. This directory is grouped by component type. For details, please see Templates Files > Templates Direcotry > [Components Subdirectory](/stencil-docs/template-files/templates-directory/components-subdirectory).\n\n### `template/layout`\n`templates/layout` define the overall structure (header, footer, etc.) for your storefront. You can implement multiple layouts here, for different use cases â€“ to make it easy to switch between different look-and-feel variations for the same theme. For details, please see Templates Files > Templates Direcotry > [Layout Subdirectory](/stencil-docs/template-files/templates-directory/layout-subdirectory).\n\n### `assets/`\n`assets/` (images, CSS and JavaScript files) will be located in this directory. For details, please see CSS And Design Assets > [Assets Directory](/stencil-docs/css-and-design-assets/assets-directory).\n\n### `lang/`\n`lang/` contains translation files, including the required `en.json`. For details, please see the _Internationalization/Localization_ section of the documentation.\n\nWhen developing in your local environment, all files that you change in your Stencil theme directory (`/cornerstone/` in our default installation) will be reflected immediately at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).\n",
