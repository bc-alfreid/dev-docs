Or moving to the Stencil templating environment from a pure HTML and CSS-based design?\n\nYou have four (non-mutually exclusive) options for developing Stencil themes:\n\n* Find a Design & Solutions Partner\n* Light Customization using the Theme Editor\n* Light Customization using HTML and CSS\n* Adapting a Stencil Theme or Developing from Scratch\n\n###  Find a Design & Solutions Partner\n\nIf you prefer to have an expert collaborator customize your theme, we recommend working with one of our certified BigCommerce Design & Solutions Partners. Reference the following resources to do so:\n\n* [Partner Directory](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/directory/search?i=75)\n* [Working with a Design Partner](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Learning/Working-with-a-Design-Partner) (Support Guide)\n\n### Light Customization with Stencil Theme Editor\n\nStencil can be customized without the use of any specialized development tools or techniques by using of the Stencil Theme Editor. The Stencil Theme Editor still enables customization of a theme's colors, typography, banners, headings, carousel, and footer. It also enables customization of broader layout characteristics, such as the number of products displayed in various panels, category pages, and brand pages.\n\nFor details, see the following support resources:\n\n* [Theme Editor](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Stencil-Themes)\n* [Personalizing Your Theme](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Learning/Personalizing-your-New-Theme) \n\n### Light Customization with HTML and CSS\n\nIf you are most comfortable working in HTML and CSS, Stencil's *Edit Theme Files* feature allows you to directly edit most of your theme's files from the Control Panel. For details, see the following resources:\n\n* [Editing Stencil Theme Files](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Stencil-Themes#edit) \n* [Getting Started with the Stencil Framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waJ1dg_dAh8&index=11&list=PLwTYtMwfzbe7EZiIWPAmPtuwRHkY7BG-0) (Video overview of copying and editing a theme's files)\n\n### Adapt a Stencil Theme, or Develop from Scratch\n\nFor complete control over a theme's appearance and logic – including the ability to edit _all_ theme configuration files – you will want to use the Stencil Command-line interface, also known as the Stencil CLI.\n\nTo learn Stencil CLI's templating conventions, see Installing Stencil CLI.
